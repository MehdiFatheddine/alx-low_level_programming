This project is aimed at developing C programs that adhere to specific requirements, such as using the Betty style, following specific compilation options, and avoiding global variables. The main goal of the project is to demonstrate proficiency in the C programming language and the ability to develop code that meets specific criteria. The project requires the development of several C files that will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with specific options. The code should be organized in a way that adheres to the allowed number of functions per file and should include a header file with function prototypes. The project also requires the creation of a README.md file that explains the project and its requirements.
