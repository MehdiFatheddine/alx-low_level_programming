Static Libraries
This project focuses on creating and using static libraries in C programming language. Static libraries are a collection of object files that are combined into a single file, making it easier to distribute and use in programs.

Requirements
The C code for this project must follow these requirements:

Compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89.
End with a new line.
Follow the Betty style. Code is checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl.
No global variables are allowed.
Maximum of 5 functions per file.
Standard library functions such as printf, puts are forbidden.
_putchar function is allowed to use.
A header file called main.h should contain prototypes for all functions and _putchar function.
The bash scripts for this project must follow these requirements:

Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
End with a new line.
The first line of all files should be exactly #!/bin/bash.
A README.md file should be present at the root of the project, describing what each script is doing.
All files must be executable.
