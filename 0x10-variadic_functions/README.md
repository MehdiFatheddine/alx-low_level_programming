0x10. C - Variadic Functions
Description
This repository contains code examples demonstrating the use of variadic functions in C. Variadic functions are functions that can accept a varying number of arguments. They are commonly used in C programming for tasks that require a flexible number of inputs, such as printing or formatting data.
Requirements
To compile and run the code examples in this repository, you will need a C compiler installed on your system, such as GCC or Clang.
Usage
To compile an individual code example, navigate to its directory and run the make command. This will generate an executable file that you can run with the command ./<executable>.
Files
The following files are included in this repository:
0-sum_them_all.c
This file contains a function that returns the sum of its arguments. The function uses a variadic parameter list to accept a varying number of integers.
1-print_numbers.c
This file contains a function that prints a list of integers separated by a given character. The function uses a variadic parameter list to accept a varying number of integers.
2-print_strings.c
This file contains a function that prints a list of strings separated by a given character. The function uses a variadic parameter list to accept a varying number of strings.
3-print_all.c
This file contains a function that prints a list of values of different types. The function uses a variadic parameter list to accept a varying number of arguments of different types.
Learning Objectives
By studying the code examples in this repository, you will learn:
What are variadic functions
How to use the va_start, va_arg, and va_end macros
Why and how to use the const type qualifier
